
This should be simple if you really passed CS210.  But be careful:  
I ask for a Line class a little different than the exercise in the text, 
which is a line segment  I'm asking for a line in general that has undefined length. 
And be certain you follow the code specifications enumerated below.  
These code specs apply to all files you submit for this course!!!

Write a class called Line that represents a line such as y=mx+b.  
Your Line class cannot have any System. calls, must have at a minimum 
the following defined, and only two private fields (attributes)::

private double slope; // the slope of this line

private double intercept; // the intercept of this line

public Line(Point p1, Point p2) // Constructor using java.awt.Point

public double getSlope() // returns the slope of this line

public boolean intersect(Line other) // true if this Line intersects another Line

public String toString() // returns a form like y=mx+b for user to examine this Line

 

Attach a simple text .java file, following the coding specs of our text, 
specifically adhering to:

File name matches class name which starts with uppercase character.
It compiles with one of the Java IDE's using JDK7
Import only java and javax classes, or other classes covered in our text
Never submit specialized IDE specific code (I might just run at command line)
Never submit those //TODO lines that show your IDE generated this and you did not change it.
Your name, date, and reasons for doing this appear as the first few lines (/** comments */)
More lines of comments, using // style, so every screen had a few comments at all times.
Proper indent of code as described in textbook, for class, methods, loops, decisions, etc...
Proper naming of objects (start lower case) using reasonably descriptive names.
Good Boolean ZEN, and never let me see while(true) or if(true) as you can do better.
ALL CODE FILES you submit to me MUST follow above guidelines, else a ZERO is possible!!!
